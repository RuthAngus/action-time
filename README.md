Comparing kinematic ages with gyrochronal ages.

Things to do next include:
1. Use distance posteriors provided in the literature.
2. Calculate vertical actions with uncertainties, including correlations between parameters.
3. Use van Saders models too (bring Jen on board).
4. Compare with Jason Sanders' theoretical models.
5. Write the paper.
