Comparing kinematic ages with gyrochronal ages.

Things to do next include:
[ ] Use distance posteriors provided by Coryn:
https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.10121.
[ ] Calculate vertical actions with uncertainties, including correlations
between parameters.
[ ] Use van Saders models too (ask Jen if she wants to join the project!).
[x] Compare with Jason Sanders' theoretical models.
[ ] Look at other kinematic age indicators like velocities, etc.
[ ] Convert the vertical actions into age estimates and make an age vs age
plot.
[ ] Write the paper.
