Comparing kinematic ages with gyrochronal ages.

Things to do next include:
1. [ ] Use distance posteriors provided by Coryn:
https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.10121.
2. [ ] Calculate vertical actions with uncertainties, including correlations
between parameters.
3. [x] Compare with approximate van Saders model.
4. [ ] Ask Jen if she wants to join the project.
5. [x] Compare with Jason Sanders' theoretical models.
    5a. [ ] Ask Jason for clarification.
6. [ ] Look at other kinematic age indicators like velocities, etc.
7. [ ] Convert the vertical actions into age estimates and make an age vs age
plot.
8. [ ] Write the paper.
