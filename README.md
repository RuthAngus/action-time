Comparing kinematic ages with gyrochronal ages.

Things to do next include:
1. [x] Use distance posteriors provided by Coryn:
https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.10121.
2. [ ] Check I'm doing the right thing with posteriors/likelihoods!
3. [x] Calculate vertical actions with uncertainties, including correlations
between parameters.
4. [x] Compare with approximate van Saders model.
5. [x] Ask Jen if she wants to join the project.
6. [x] Compare with Jason Sanders' theoretical models.
    6a. [ ] Ask Jason for clarification.
7. [ ] Look at other kinematic age indicators like velocities, etc.
8. [ ] Convert the vertical actions into age estimates and make an age vs age
plot.
9. [ ] Compare with AVR for Cannon giants (APOGEE, RAVE) and asteroseismic
giants.
10. [ ] Look at the AVR for stars with different metallicities.
11. [ ] Write the paper.
