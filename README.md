Comparing kinematic ages with gyrochronal ages.

Things to do next include:
1. Use distance posteriors provided by Coryn:

2. Calculate vertical actions with uncertainties, including correlations
between parameters. [checkbox:unchecked]
3. Use van Saders models too (ask Jen if she wants to join the project!).
